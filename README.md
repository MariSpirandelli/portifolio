#Personal projects to be my portifolio

Hi, my name is Marianna, 28 year old, Brazilian, I have Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Uberl√¢ndia Federal University, I am a full stack developer with 7 years of experience, including a year and a half as Project Coordinator, and experience in three different start-ups building new products with new technologies.

Generalist by nature, I am experienced working as System Analyst / full stack developer in many different technologies around J2EE and .Net platforms, good knowledge of CSS, HTML5, Javascript and AngularJs. Always working with Agile Methods, and in the last company (my third start-up) for almost two years, I had been working in a Project Coordinator focused role. This had involved: coordinating both new and existing products; involvement in all stages of the product lifecycle and ensuring high quality and timely releases within scope using agile methodologies, as well as dealing with clients. In the end, I was managing five projects which had helped me to improve my time management and organisational skills.

I am very flexible, organized, easy going person, dynamic, communicative, hard-working, good at working in teams, a quick learner and always willing to learn new things and open to new challenges.
